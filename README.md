# Structuring a Momentum Portfolio using GARCH Processes

## Introduction:
Welcome to our project repository on structuring a momentum portfolio using GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) processes. This README serves as a guide to understanding the purpose, implementation, and potential applications of our project.

## Project Overview:
In this project, we explore the application of GARCH processes in the context of constructing and managing a momentum portfolio. Momentum investing involves selecting assets that have shown recent positive price trends, believing that these trends will continue in the future. GARCH processes, on the other hand, are used to model and forecast the volatility of financial time series data, which is crucial for risk management in portfolio construction.

## Purpose:
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how incorporating GARCH processes can enhance the effectiveness of momentum strategies by accounting for volatility dynamics. By modeling volatility, we aim to improve risk-adjusted returns and optimize portfolio allocation decisions.

## Implementation:
The project is implemented using Python programming language, utilizing libraries such as NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, and matplotlib for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. We leverage historical financial data to construct a momentum portfolio and fit GARCH models to estimate volatility. Additionally, we employ various performance metrics and backtesting techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy.

## Instructions for Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries mentioned.
3. Ask for the required data or just download your own and modify the data importation function parameters.
5. Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and open the Jupyter notebooks to follow the analysis step by step.
6. Execute the code cells in the notebooks sequentially to replicate the analysis and results.
7. Customize parameters, data sources, or models as needed for your specific use case.
